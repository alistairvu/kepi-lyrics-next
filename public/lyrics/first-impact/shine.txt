Hello! Here we go... Say, woah!
This heart-pounding moment, hey
I look at you, oh
I know it was you who protected my dream (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone time, that's fine
I'm not afraid, yeah, you know it
You are my strength in every moment
Yeah you make me dream
Everytime, when I face you, I'm becoming stronger
Protect me, baby, hold me baby
Never let go of this hand
A light that will wake me up on days when I want to give it all up
I finally found it, it's you
That lit me up
Come on baby, better make it pop
Now I, no wonder why (Hey)
I'm not at a loss (Oh)
I'll follow your light and shine brightly
I see it over there (Go)
The wonderland for only us (We know it)
With all my might I'll go on ahead
Yeah you make me free
Every time you hold my hand, I fly some more
Remember me baby, trust me baby
Don't forget this moment
A light that will lead me to a new place
I finally found it, it's you
That lit me up
Take it to the top
Better make it pop
Now open your eyes to the dream you've been, whole new world (Light it all)
In this moment that will shine forever
I will dream of a new dream again
We don't ever want to stop
Don't want to stop, don't want to stop
Don't want to stop
Like a dream, baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Become a star, I'm going to make you shine
High up in the sky
You make me feeling pop, pop
For you, who protected me
I'm going to make you shine
Shine, shine
Come on everybody, Run towards the light
Come closer, now take my hand
Go higher, I'm not afraid
You and I will be together
We can't stop, believe in us
Now I'm going to make you shine
Hello baby, shake it baby
Come on baby, take it to the top (We can)
