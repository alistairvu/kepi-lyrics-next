Where is the place, That was so far away I could only look at it from afar?
No matter how hard I try, I can't get any further away, oh-oh-oh
In my heart that has fallen from exhaustion
Shining brightly, Shining starlight
Hold me so that I can stand up again, oh-oh
Another dream together with you
I'm not afraid of anything in this world anymore
Another day, even if I get lost, It's always in me, Another dream
Take my hand, look up the sky
Walk out, following the dazzling light
Fill the world with colour
The dream I've always been drawing
The moment we were together
That place will always be in my dreams, oh-oh, oh
You protected me through the hard times
I will never forget your precious heart
Remember the moment that you dreamed of, on that cloud
Let's walk together in this dream
Looking at the same place like this Forever
