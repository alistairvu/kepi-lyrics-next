Hey! It's you, and I. Let's start
N-N-Now arrived at this place, Watch my step
Follow my signal, five, four, three, two, one (Aha)
The adventure of my dreams is near (It's here)
Take off with me, with me, let's go (Muah!)
One step, one step as I go, My heart trembles (Like it)
Clear dream, I feel it, eh-oh, eh-oh
Heads up, run towards your dream
Stand up, the dream of you and me higher, higher
We'll run faster than anyone else To where you are
One, check it, two, carefully
Raise it a bit higher, radar, radar
You'll notice me trembling
I'm going to be brave, yeah (Like it)
Catch your breath and again, get set, go, eh-oh, eh-oh
Heads up, let go of fear
Stand up together higher, higher
We'll run faster than anyone else To the place we've been picturing
Yeah, run around and round
Don't stop trip on
An adventure where dreams come true
Where are you? Do you see me?
Here, I'll send a signal, catch it
Now get up together
Even when I'm out of breath I won't give up
Run-run-run you'll see me
Wa-da-da-da
Running vroom-vroom-vroom Like a supersonic (Let's go)
Wa-da-da, wa-da-da, run (Right now)
My heart is beating like crazy
To you, wa-da-da-da
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Kep one going, wa-da-da-da
