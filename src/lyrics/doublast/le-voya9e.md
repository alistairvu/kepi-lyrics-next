A perfect voyage

The sound of waves surging in far beyond the horizon

Between the clouds, we going high

Follow me in my way

When the gentle breeze blows, close your eyes and feel it

We arrived to an unfamiliar island, slowly open your eyes

When the waves ripple in your eyes, Go like this

Chiki-taka, Go for a row

Tiki-taka, Play in the water

When we come across each oth–µr, what a perfect voyage

You are my wishing boat, You are my tidal wave

The waves make me dance

The crying sound in the deep sea gives me a slow hug

I wanna be free
