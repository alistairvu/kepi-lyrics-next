Stoppin' your pace with me, You're talkin' in a different tone

What is this? It's like ice cream

Even these emotions I narrowly put on it, ooh-ooh-ooh oh

Even the gaze that you gave me like I knew it or not, oh

Something special today, everything around us turns into love, yeah

What do you think will happen?

I've got your attention, I can feel your tension

When you look at me, your eyes alr–µady speak

Who cares? Just be honest, before it's too late

Gotta love, gotta love, gotta love

Give me that attention

Speak up, speak up, yeah, sick of friend's sign

Don't you wanna go? To the next page, we go

A new genre has started

It just so happens that something is a plot

Reach out to your red-imbued heart
