song: Good Night
album: DOUBLAST

I hide under a blanket, like your cozy arms

Tossing and turning, tossing and turning

I think of you as always
Even the petty way of speaking, And the smallest acts, I'm concernedly bothered by it

How is your night?

There's your star, my star, full of light in the boundless sky

I was looking at it and then sleep gradually

It's gonna be a good night

A dream so pretty with you

My closed windows were knocked open

Romantic in the middle of the night

My Romeo, you

It's the end of a tiring day

I'm thinking about you and me closer tomorrow

Sleep tight, good night, good night to you
