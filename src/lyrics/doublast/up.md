I do, I do, tomorrow and today, don't waste it (na-na-na-na), don't waste it (always)

I'm good, I'm good, cast a spell, cooler, cooler

Yellow and blue fantastic

In the coolest color, pick it

Ringing and poppin', oh, can we pop in, about to take off, you ready?

The thrilling eyes are shut tight, come on and open your eyes

What do you see? Now's the time!

HEREEEEEEEE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

We go, it's my imaginary island, follow and line up

If you're ready, up, up, up, up, up!

We go, there's a rainbow in the clouds, follow and open the closеd door

We go up, up, up, up, up

Kеp1 up, up, up, up, up

Ringing and poppin', oh, can we pop in? Deeper 'til the very end

Kep1 moving, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, my heart is racing, Let's bungee into the imagination
