Suddenly I though of the bright day we met

I close my eyes for a moment, rewind

It's you who showed me every beautiful scene, with the love that shines like stars

The happiest moment in the time we spent together, rewind again

I miss the season that bloomed with excitement

Every momеnt is like a dream I don't want to wake up

You and I drеam the same dream, we always shine the light

Make it last forever and ever, today rewind

It's getting clearer, the times we cried and laughed

It fills up my heart, it's unforgettable

It's you who has protected me in the sad scenes - the words you said, your warmth

You're always on my mind, so I'm not lonely now
