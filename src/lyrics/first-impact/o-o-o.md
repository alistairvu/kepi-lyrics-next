It's time for the sky to open, And connect you and I in my dreams, beyond the stars

Loudly call out my name, my beating heart, higher, I'm ready to depart, Ready set, oh!

How do I send it more clearly, My sign, You too are attracted to my universe

My heart beats over, wink twinkles over, Accept my heart, Over and over and over

I'm going to be your star, My style is more certain

I see it over there, over, If I miss it, game over

Hold my hand

Oh, oh, oh, I will only shout to you like this

Oh, oh, oh, why don't you know my heart like this?

baro naya!

I want to meet you, where are you? I'm curious about your world

Same moment, different space, you and I, Dreaming the same dream

Answer me, over, I'm waiting for you, Step by step, a little closer

My dream now crosses the universe to you, It's being passed on
