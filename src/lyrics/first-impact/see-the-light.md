Look at my eyes, What are you looking for? See the light

Crossing between the endless daylight, Revolving around me, I can't stop burning out

It's similar, this street is getting closer

Catch your eye, catch your mind (Yeah)

I could be anywhere, I could be anyone (Anyway)

It's as clear as if you could touch it, yeah (Yeah)

Don't take your eyes off of it, I'm looking for the place

It was all in my head, Led by the transparent light

A starry night drawn in front of my eyes, A place for my dreams

Did you see the lights?

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm getting closer

I can't wait anymore, You're getting closer, I keep you in my heart

Entrust yourself to the aurora that flies

All the way to the end, Go far away, To the place you and I dreamed of

We are Kep1er

This is Kep1er
