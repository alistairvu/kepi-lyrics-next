Are you sure? Are you serious? Maybe you're living in a different time

Are you happy? What are you up to? I'll invite you to my imaginary world

Don't push yourself away Through that small gap in the door

The senses of the whole world stopped

It's not fake, it's real

In a mask, dyed in the world, Show me the real you, babe

The persona hidden in the mirror

A more happy mood, your own room

Pretty in a little mask, your ego

Copy and paste, touch and push, Time is flowing (Shedding)

The persona hidden in the mirror

The deeper it goes the thicker the forest gets, look, look

I can't draw a line to the fantasy world

The world I imagined, I'll show you it all. Hold my hand, log on

Mask, And fantasy (Aye-aye-aye)

I'm not fake, I'm waiting for you, face to face (Aye-aye-aye)

I can't understand why. From one to ten, It's so real. It's like a smile without lies

Open the door, look around, Just look at me now

Wa-ah, I turn imagination into reality

Take off your mask

Bap-bap, bap-bap, You work it out

Fill up all of your emotions, So that I can feel them
