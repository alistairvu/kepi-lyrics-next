Hey! It's you, and I. Let's start

N-N-Now arrived at this place, Watch my step

Follow my signal, five, four, three, two, one, The adventure of my dreams is near (It's here)

Take off with me, with me, let's go (Muah!)

One step, one step as I go, My heart trembles (Like it)

Clear dream, I feel it, eh-oh, eh-oh

Heads up, run towards your dream

Stand up, the dream of you and me higher, higher

We'll run faster than anyone else To where you are

One, check it, two, carefully, Raise it a bit higher, radar, radar

You'll notice me trembling, I'm going to be brave, yeah (Like it)

Catch your breath and again, get set, go, eh-oh, eh-oh

Heads up, let go of fear, Stand up together higher, higher

We'll run faster than anyone else To the place we've been picturing

Yeah, run around and round, Don't stop trip on

An adventure where dreams come true

Where are you? Do you see me?, Here, I'll send a signal, catch it

Now get up together, Even when I'm out of breath I won't give up

Run-run-run you'll see me

Running vroom-vroom-vroom Like a supersonic (Let's go)

Wa-da-da, wa-da-da, run (Right now)

My heart is beating like crazy, To you, wa-da-da-da

Kep 1 going, wa-da-da-da
