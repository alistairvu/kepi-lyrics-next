Got me feeling high, the moment I first saw you

You and I no doubt, we hold hands

This quivering feeling, I think we’re been attracted to one another

I get a feeling, On the empty formula

When we add you and I, all other solutions are all pass

It’s love, do it now

Like a “+” “+” if it adds

We’re together, we become stronger than two

This moment, it can’t be stopped

You know, it’s better, U plus Me equals love

It’s Love, U plus Me, U U plus Me, yeah

You and I who will blindly shine more than any love

We’re together, never stop us now

U plus me, it’s love

Don’t hesitate, don’t stop, You and me, we got the love

Run along with me, To that new world

Like a shudder, make it bounce, recklessly ride the rhythm

Just the way you were drawn, feel the vibe

Just like this we become closer, can you feel me?

In our own formula, If you were to be excluded, all other answers, no path. Only you can, make it right

Never, never let go, You’re the one I’ve dreamt of

It’s you and me, now baby
