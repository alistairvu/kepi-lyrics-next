Do you perhaps feel it too, that starlight enveloping us

I gain courage when my hands touches, Finding those puffed up dreams

Even if I happen to lose my way in the thick darkness, It’s okay, those days could happen

When I’m a bit exhausted, Come to me and grab my hand

I’m anticipating it, yell it out loudly, Towards that light I’ve been waiting long for

I’ve been waiting, Should I fly up high, in front of my eyes that spreads across My Utopia

Wherever I’m going, whoever I’m meeting, It’s okay even if it’s an uncertain future

I can imagine a surprising tomorrow, I’m anticipating it daily, even today

If somehow I were to be blocked by a high wall, It’s okay, I won’t give up anymore

If I look a bit worn out, come to me and slightly embrace me

A dazzling sun, I follow the light, If I were to confidently walk step by step

How would today’s “me” be remembered in the distant future? I look forward to it
