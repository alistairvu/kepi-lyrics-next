I’m a snake, I’m on my way to hunt you

Careful, I', dangerous wo

I steal your smile, it’s time now

I come closer and closer, more and more thrillingly

I can feel your temperature becoming clearer

In an instant I win you over

No matter what it is that I want, When I’m giving you the chance, tell me your last wish

Woo the night’s calling me, In the night tralala, the song tralala

Woo the moon is encouraging me, my heart starts to burn. Oh no, you innocent child!

Hook and go bam bam bam, breathlessly I go bam bam bam

The thrilling eye contact goes to hell

Right here, I climb up on top of your heart like bam bam bam

Should I ask, your honesty. Should I ask, so it stings like that

Should I bite, your honesty. Should I bite, so it stings like that

Boldly I twist it, and once again you’re trippin’ for me

Dumb dumb, you’ve already got your heart taken

I slowly wrap around, you’ll suffocate probably

As I have you locked inside me, I wanna smell the sweet scent alone

You’re begging for me to let go, Now it’s whatever happens, happens

Now I’m gonna gonna gonna, end it, This is the last dish, um

A little more, please love me more, Just like that, leave yourself to me

I permeate inside of your heart and I embrace you tightly, So you won’t be able to escape me
