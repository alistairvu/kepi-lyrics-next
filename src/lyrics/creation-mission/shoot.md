From somewhere you go JJAN! and appear

You go pass in front of me riding an awesome board

I thought I was some protagonist in a movie, As if I was watching a slow-mo

This is difficult, People line up for me anywhere else so why I’m just yeah... Just you know

Acting coy, I didn’t even make eye contact or show expressions, And played hard to get, But my face is like, I’m so so hot hot hot

Oh to be honest I think it’s too late to act as if I don’t know, The unimaginable situation of mine, it’s gotten a bit serious

A languid afternoon, a sunny day, I happened to come outside my house

With a stretched out t-shirt and my disheveled face, I acted as if I was sick... But in my head goes Pop! Pop!

It hasn’t even started so why Does it feel like it already ended

It’s okay, this could possibly be a start For me to be more honest now

Maybe or maybe not, meanwhile you’re very cool

What should I do? I’m sick Shoot! Shoot!

Maybe or maybe not, why did it have to be today?

It’s a bit more odd today, From head to toe, I’m uncomfortable

It’s due to you, what do I do

1 second feels like a day

It was almost reachable, It was almost knowable

Only if today didn’t exist, How nice would that have been
